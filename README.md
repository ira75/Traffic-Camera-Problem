# Traffic Camera Problem
This project report analyses the efficiency of different methods to find minimum vertex cover of a graph, which is an NP-hard problem. The three approaches to solve the minimum vertex cover problem used are MiniSAT solver (CNF-SAT-VC) and two other approximation algorithms, referred to as APPROX-VC-1 and APPROX-VC-2 in the report. The efficiency analysis is done based on running time and approximation ratio of each approach. CNF-SAT-VC is found to be the most effective way to solve the vertex cover problem.
